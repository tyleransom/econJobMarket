We seek candidates at all experience levels for both the Research area and the Risk Analysis area. Entry level economists do not require banking research or experience. Mid-career and senior economists are expected to have experience in economics, banking, or finance. 

Research Area:
Financial Economists balance independently generated scholarly research with policy work. Research generally focuses on banking, finance, risk measurement, deposit insurance, and systemic risk, among other topics. The research is disseminated in peer-reviewed academic, industry, professional, and FDIC journals, publications, and conferences. The FDIC has an active seminar series and economists have access to a wide range of proprietary data. The FDIC supports the Center for Financial Research (CFR) which organizes conferences, sponsors visiting scholars, and undertakes other activities that support the agency's research mission (visit https://fdic.gov/bank/analytical/cfr/ for more information). In addition, the economists support agency functions in several ways. For example, they review quantitative models used by banks for measuring financial risks such as credit, interest rate, and operational risk. Economists also develop and maintain quantitative models to support FDIC functions, including: deposit insurance pricing, deposit insurance fund management, stress testing, and resolving banks in the least costly manner. Economists may also perform policy-focused research on current topics such as cross-border resolutions, international capital requirements, and the stability of deposit insurance systems.

Risk Analysis Area:
Financial Economists analyze conditions and events in the economy and financial markets. They identify emerging risks, and analyze their impact on the economy, financial markets, banking sector, and Deposit Insurance Fund. Economists perform a variety of complex quantitative and qualitative analyses, both independently and as team members, and they present findings to FDIC senior leadership, FDIC staff, and external groups through presentations, briefings, publications, and outreach events.

Timeline: There is no firm deadline for applying.

Summary:

We are looking for a Senior Fellow with a strong background in causal inference and quantitative research methods (either through academic coursework at the graduate level or previous work experience) and a demonstrated interest in global health and/or development to lead our work assessing the evidence and cost-effectiveness of global health and development interventions such as immunization campaigns, bednet distribution, breastfeeding promotion, etc.

This position would be a great fit for a candidate who wants to apply a rigorous methodological background toward making real-world funding decisions at a small, agile organization.

Our top charities - to which we directed over $110 million in 2015 - are evaluated largely based on the cost-effectiveness and strength of the academic evidence for the interventions they implement. In addition, we recommend a number of grants to early-stage organizations carrying out strong interventions, and studies that could improve the evidence for interventions, in the hopes that these grants will lead eventually to new top charities. 

Job description:

The Senior Fellow will contribute to our core research and will also have the opportunity to allocate some time to pursuing her/his own original research agenda including publishing in peer-reviewed journals if she/he desires.

The Senior Fellow will be responsible for:
-Prioritizing the interventions we consider for funding.
-Assessing the evidence behind an intervention: can it be causally linked to improving people's lives? How much uncertainty is there about the magnitude of this impact? All evidence should be approached in a critical, open-minded way, recognizing the case both for and against attributing causality. We do not exclusively consider randomized controlled trials, nor do we use them uncritically.
-Assessing the cost-effectiveness of an intervention: all things considered, how much good can be accomplished per dollar spent? Our cost-effectiveness models are often fairly complex and require creative approaches to making a number of judgment calls. 
-Assessing the room for more funding for an intervention: what does the global gap look like, and how practical would it be to increase delivery with increased funding?
-Working alongside staff evaluating funding opportunities to (a) evaluate evidence provided by organizations seeking funding and (b) consider the similarity between the program the organization implements and the existing evidence.
-Staying up to date on relevant academic literature that may lead to new ideas for interventions to consider for funding.

Qualifications and characteristics:

-Ph.D. in economics, public health, or statistics or equivalent experience. Exceptions may be made for outstanding applicants who do not meet this criterion.
-At least three years of research or policy-related experience. Exceptions may be made for outstanding applicants who do not meet this criterion.
-Passionate about finding great giving opportunities and making the world a better place.
-Value intense discussion and debate.
-Strong critical thinking skills; able to approach all claims (including their managers') with skepticism.
-Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal.
-Comfortable with open-ended questions, where no clear precedents or guidelines exist.
-Value the intensity and open-endedness of a small organization over the stability and comfort of a larger corporation.

Please note:

We prefer candidates who will be based at our office in San Francisco, but we are open to someone who works remotely.
We will consider sponsoring applications for work authorization for exceptional candidates.

Academy Scholars Program, 2017-2018

The Academy Scholars Program identifies and supports outstanding scholars at the start of their careers whose work combines disciplinary excellence in the social sciences (including history and law) with a command of the language, history, or culture of non-Western countries or regions.  Their scholarship may elucidate domestic, comparative, or transnational issues, past or present.  

The Academy Scholars are a select community of individuals with resourcefulness, initiative, curiosity, and originality, whose work in non-Western cultures or regions shows promise as a foundation for exceptional careers in major universities or international institutions.  Harvard Academy Scholarships are open only to recent PhD (or comparable professional school degree) recipients and doctoral candidates.  Those still pursuing a PhD should have completed their routine training and be well along in the writing of their theses before applying to become Academy Scholars; those in possession of a PhD longer than 3 years at the time of application are ineligible.

Academy Scholars are appointed for 2 years by the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies and are provided time, guidance, and access to Harvard University facilities.  They receive substantial financial and research assistance to undertake sustained projects of research and/or acquire accessory training in their chosen fields and areas.  Some teaching is permitted but not required.  The Senior Scholars, a distinguished group of senior Harvard University faculty members, act as mentors to the Academy Scholars to help them achieve their intellectual potential.

Postdoctoral Academy Scholars will receive an annual stipend of $67,000, and predoctoral Academy Scholars will receive an annual stipend of $31,000 until they are awarded the PhD or equivalent degree.  The online application for the 2017-2018 class of Academy Scholars is due by October 1, 2016.  Finalist interviews will take place in Cambridge on December 6, 2016.  Notification of Scholarships will be made in late December, 2016.

‚Ä¢	Development of an econometric model for forecasting the supply of recruits that highlights risks to Army recruiting and suggests policy improvements; 
‚Ä¢	Assessments of the $65B/year DoD health care program that suggest market-oriented reforms; 
‚Ä¢	Enhancement of parametric models to forecast major weapon system costs like the Joint Strike Fighter with an expected total program cost of $233B;

‚Ä¢	Hedonic analysis to correct for quality differences in calculating price indices for fighter aircraft; 
‚Ä¢	Examination of how to select a discount rate for calculating lump-sum payments as part of the military retirement package.

Rockefeller Visiting Faculty Fellowships for the academic year 2017-18. Fellows devote an academic year in residence at Princeton to research and writing about topics involving human values in public and private life. The program is open to all scholars provided their research plans qualify. In recent years fellows have been drawn from fields including philosophy, political theory, literature, history, classics, economics and law, but this list is not meant to be exhaustive.

Fellows are expected to reside in or around Princeton and to be active contributors to the intellectual life of the Center, including participation in a weekly seminar attended by fellows and Center faculty to discuss work in progress and in various other events sponsored by the Center. 

Candidates should have a doctorate or equivalent professional degree and a strong record of research publications appropriate to their career stage. Typically Fellows hold faculty positions at other universities or colleges; in exceptional cases we consider applications from independent scholars when there is a high level of scholarly achievement. This is not a post-doctoral fellowship program and we do not generally consider candidates who will have held the Ph.D. for less than two years at the time of appointment.

The fellowship period extends from September 1 to July 1. Fellows normally receive stipends of up to one-half their academic-year salaries (subject to a minimum and maximum set each fall). Ordinarily their home institutions provide a portion of their salaries in addition to all benefits, although this is not a requirement for appointment. Stipends for independent scholars will not exceed the maximum for fellows holding appointments elsewhere.

The main considerations in the evaluation of applications are the following:

The significance of the proposed research and its relevance to the purposes of the University Center for Human Values(see http://uchv.princeton.edu/ for more information);

The quality of a candidate‚Äôs previous research and the contribution the candidate is likely to make in the future through teaching and writing;

The likelihood that the research would benefit from being conducted in the University Center environment.
