Rockefeller Visiting Faculty Fellowships for the academic year 2017-18. Fellows devote an academic year in residence at Princeton to research and writing about topics involving human values in public and private life. The program is open to all scholars provided their research plans qualify. In recent years fellows have been drawn from fields including philosophy, political theory, literature, history, classics, economics and law, but this list is not meant to be exhaustive.

Fellows are expected to reside in or around Princeton and to be active contributors to the intellectual life of the Center, including participation in a weekly seminar attended by fellows and Center faculty to discuss work in progress and in various other events sponsored by the Center. 

Candidates should have a doctorate or equivalent professional degree and a strong record of research publications appropriate to their career stage. Typically Fellows hold faculty positions at other universities or colleges; in exceptional cases we consider applications from independent scholars when there is a high level of scholarly achievement. This is not a post-doctoral fellowship program and we do not generally consider candidates who will have held the Ph.D. for less than two years at the time of appointment.

The fellowship period extends from September 1 to July 1. Fellows normally receive stipends of up to one-half their academic-year salaries (subject to a minimum and maximum set each fall). Ordinarily their home institutions provide a portion of their salaries in addition to all benefits, although this is not a requirement for appointment. Stipends for independent scholars will not exceed the maximum for fellows holding appointments elsewhere.

The main considerations in the evaluation of applications are the following:

The significance of the proposed research and its relevance to the purposes of the University Center for Human Values(see http://uchv.princeton.edu/ for more information);

The quality of a candidate’s previous research and the contribution the candidate is likely to make in the future through teaching and writing;

The likelihood that the research would benefit from being conducted in the University Center environment.

Timeline: There is no firm deadline for applying.

Summary:

We are looking for a Senior Fellow with a strong background in causal inference and quantitative research methods (either through academic coursework at the graduate level or previous work experience) and a demonstrated interest in global health and/or development to lead our work assessing the evidence and cost-effectiveness of global health and development interventions such as immunization campaigns, bednet distribution, breastfeeding promotion, etc.

This position would be a great fit for a candidate who wants to apply a rigorous methodological background toward making real-world funding decisions at a small, agile organization.

Our top charities - to which we directed over $110 million in 2015 - are evaluated largely based on the cost-effectiveness and strength of the academic evidence for the interventions they implement. In addition, we recommend a number of grants to early-stage organizations carrying out strong interventions, and studies that could improve the evidence for interventions, in the hopes that these grants will lead eventually to new top charities. 

Job description:

The Senior Fellow will contribute to our core research and will also have the opportunity to allocate some time to pursuing her/his own original research agenda including publishing in peer-reviewed journals if she/he desires.

The Senior Fellow will be responsible for:
-Prioritizing the interventions we consider for funding.
-Assessing the evidence behind an intervention: can it be causally linked to improving people's lives? How much uncertainty is there about the magnitude of this impact? All evidence should be approached in a critical, open-minded way, recognizing the case both for and against attributing causality. We do not exclusively consider randomized controlled trials, nor do we use them uncritically.
-Assessing the cost-effectiveness of an intervention: all things considered, how much good can be accomplished per dollar spent? Our cost-effectiveness models are often fairly complex and require creative approaches to making a number of judgment calls. 
-Assessing the room for more funding for an intervention: what does the global gap look like, and how practical would it be to increase delivery with increased funding?
-Working alongside staff evaluating funding opportunities to (a) evaluate evidence provided by organizations seeking funding and (b) consider the similarity between the program the organization implements and the existing evidence.
-Staying up to date on relevant academic literature that may lead to new ideas for interventions to consider for funding.

Qualifications and characteristics:

-Ph.D. in economics, public health, or statistics or equivalent experience. Exceptions may be made for outstanding applicants who do not meet this criterion.
-At least three years of research or policy-related experience. Exceptions may be made for outstanding applicants who do not meet this criterion.
-Passionate about finding great giving opportunities and making the world a better place.
-Value intense discussion and debate.
-Strong critical thinking skills; able to approach all claims (including their managers') with skepticism.
-Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal.
-Comfortable with open-ended questions, where no clear precedents or guidelines exist.
-Value the intensity and open-endedness of a small organization over the stability and comfort of a larger corporation.

Please note:

We prefer candidates who will be based at our office in San Francisco, but we are open to someone who works remotely.
We will consider sponsoring applications for work authorization for exceptional candidates.

The Census Bureau provides an excellent environment for empirically-oriented economists to use confidential microdata on businesses and households, linked employer-employee data, and confidential microdata from federal and state administrative and statistical agencies to conduct research on a wide range of topics. These topics include business dynamics (industrial organization, productivity, trade, entrepreneurship, innovation); labor dynamics (employment, worker flows); income dynamics (earnings, taxation, assets, poverty, program participation); health (disability, health status, insurance markets); public (state and local government activities); and household dynamics (family structure, education, migration). 

Economists' activities include presenting analytical and methodological research at professional conferences; publishing in scholarly journals; writing descriptive reports for the public; maintaining and improving data collection; and responding to inquiries from Congress, the press, and the public on topics of interest. Experience with firm-, household-, and/or industry-level data is especially valued, as are skills in data manipulation, analysis, and big data techniques.  U.S. citizenship is required. Positions are subject to budgetary approval. The Census Bureau is an equal opportunity employer. Please submit materials using the JOE application.

Keystone is a premier technology-industry consulting firm that delivers extremely novel solutions to the most challenging strategy and economics problems. We work with the world’s leading companies, including Facebook, Nike, Amazon, Microsoft, GE, Intel, Expedia, Zillow, LinkedIn and others. Our team members learn the most advanced strategy, analytical and general management skills commonly practiced by firms like McKinsey and Bain while also developing entrepreneurial skills to build high growth businesses. We develop thought leadership in management science and economics by working alongside experts from top institutions including Harvard, Stanford, Wharton, Kellogg, and MIT.

Keystone teams derive extraordinary insights through rigorous analysis of large scale datasets. Our autonomy to operate across the full value chain of unstructured data requires a core team of creative, analytical talent. Keystone offers a unique opportunity for Economists to take one of two equally challenging paths to Partner: (1) be a generalist and manage projects broadly or (2) develop deep expertise in one or more economic practice areas (such as antitrust, intellectual property, etc.) and create extraordinary impact. Our focus on training and development and constant engagement with a network of world-class academic experts and business leaders positions us well to guide our economists along either career path.

Keystone is looking for great candidates who want to advance their careers and business skills while learning to build companies. Economists work side by side with experienced managers and partners and top academic experts and engage directly with clients who lead in their industries. 

At Keystone, we invest heavily in the career advancement of our Economists. We have an extremely successful track record of building differentiated professional and personal CVs for our team members. Our Economists have consistently gone on to senior positions in our firm and prominent operating positions in high growth firms. Whatever the path —– our Economist team members and alumni move into leadership positions far before their peers.

Candidates should have a PhD in economics (or will graduate with a PhD in 2017) and superlative economic and econometric modeling skills. Ideal candidates will have significant experience working with at least one major statistical software package (such as Stata, Python, R or SAS) as well as constructing and analyzing large datasets. 

What will you learn at Keystone?

#1 You will develop an Entrepreneurial Mindset: You will take on challenges before you have the resources to complete them, and you will learn to marshal the resources necessary to succeed. This skill will differentiate you in every future endeavor – you will know how to start from scratch and get things done.

#2 You will embrace your Passion for Technology: You will solve hard challenges for leading-edge science and technology companies in several areas including: online advertising, mobile applications, internet search, social media, internet of things, and others.

#3 You will work with Big Data: By working alongside economists and academic experts, you will learn sophisticated modeling approaches and econometric techniques required to manipulate and draw conclusions from the enormous data sets available to companies today.

#4 You will have Extraordinary Impact: We believe a great workplace is working with superstar colleagues, and we regularly exceed client expectations by surprising them with our creativity and insight.

Application Process:

We believe that rewarding job experiences depend on strong “fit.” We ask all applicants to provide a resume and a short and specific cover letter describing how Keystone can advance your career goals. Some topics that you might consider in your letter include:
1. What sets you and your work apart from your peers?
2. What do you hope to achieve in the next 3 to 5 years of your career?
3. How might Keystone help you achieve this?

There are 2 positions open in Cambridge, MA. Candidates are required to have completed a Ph.D. in economics or closely related fields before starting at Microsoft Research. Past economics postdocs have consistently moved on to assistant professor positions at the very best departments.

Access to Data: Postdoctoral researchers have wide-ranging access to Microsoft data. While certainly not constrained to utilize Microsoft data assets, we expect empirical researchers to benefit greatly from access to data from various Microsoft businesses. In the past research has used data on online advertising auctions, Xbox Live platform, web browsing and internal datasets related to firm and employee behavior. 

Interdisciplinary: Permanent researchers include top scholars in anthropology, applied mathematics, biology, communications, computer science, economics, law, machine learning, physics, psychology, sociology and statistics, physics. Postdoctoral researchers in past years have collaborated extensively across disciplinary boundaries with great success and we expect attention to such interdisciplinary research to grow further as economics and computer science become more tightly integrated as fields.

Fields: We are particularly interested in candidates with expertise in auctions and market design, platform economics, industrial organization, personnel economics, social networks analysis, behavioral economics, economics of digitization and e-commerce and applied game theory. However, exceptional candidates in all fields will receive full consideration.

We seek candidates at all experience levels for both the Research area and the Risk Analysis area. Entry level economists do not require banking research or experience. Mid-career and senior economists are expected to have experience in economics, banking, or finance. 

Research Area:
Financial Economists balance independently generated scholarly research with policy work. Research generally focuses on banking, finance, risk measurement, deposit insurance, and systemic risk, among other topics. The research is disseminated in peer-reviewed academic, industry, professional, and FDIC journals, publications, and conferences. The FDIC has an active seminar series and economists have access to a wide range of proprietary data. The FDIC supports the Center for Financial Research (CFR) which organizes conferences, sponsors visiting scholars, and undertakes other activities that support the agency's research mission (visit https://fdic.gov/bank/analytical/cfr/ for more information). In addition, the economists support agency functions in several ways. For example, they review quantitative models used by banks for measuring financial risks such as credit, interest rate, and operational risk. Economists also develop and maintain quantitative models to support FDIC functions, including: deposit insurance pricing, deposit insurance fund management, stress testing, and resolving banks in the least costly manner. Economists may also perform policy-focused research on current topics such as cross-border resolutions, international capital requirements, and the stability of deposit insurance systems.

Risk Analysis Area:
Financial Economists analyze conditions and events in the economy and financial markets. They identify emerging risks, and analyze their impact on the economy, financial markets, banking sector, and Deposit Insurance Fund. Economists perform a variety of complex quantitative and qualitative analyses, both independently and as team members, and they present findings to FDIC senior leadership, FDIC staff, and external groups through presentations, briefings, publications, and outreach events.

The FDIC is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

","Economist ","The Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) is a non-profit corporation supporting the Department of Defense and other federal government agencies with applied economics and multi-disciplinary research. IDA researchers support senior defense officials by applying economic theory to issues of National Security policy and resource management. This ranges from applying proven tools to new problems and data, to developing new models, to generating new theory. Recent examples include:
•	Development of an econometric model for forecasting the supply of recruits that highlights risks to Army recruiting and suggests policy improvements; 
•	Assessments of the $65B/year DoD health care program that suggest market-oriented reforms; 
•	Enhancement of parametric models to forecast major weapon system costs like the Joint Strike Fighter with an expected total program cost of $233B;
•	Development of metrics to measure the success of border-control initiatives; 
•	Development of a stochastic model to analyze the ability of alternative force structures to address an uncertain future; 
•	Hedonic analysis to correct for quality differences in calculating price indices for fighter aircraft; 
•	Examination of how to select a discount rate for calculating lump-sum payments as part of the military retirement package.

IDA takes great pride in the high caliber and timeliness of its analyses, which are produced in an atmosphere that encourages independent thinking and objective results. Work at IDA is conducted in a team environment and often involves a multi-disciplinary approach with physicists, engineers, economists, and other social scientists. Researchers work closely with and are in frequent contact with government sponsors. Consequently, strong communication skills are greatly valued.

","Associate Director, Financial Institutions and Risk Management and Associate Director, Financial Markets","Join a growing office with important financial stability responsibilities. 

This is a unique opportunity to expand scholarship in financial stability for the benefit of the public and policymakers using financial data unavailable elsewhere.

The Office of Financial Research (OFR) promotes financial stability by analyzing the impact of financial policies and regulations, conducting research on financial stability issues, developing tools to monitor financial institutions and markets, addressing data gaps, improving data standards, and promoting best practices in financial risk management. 

The Research and Analysis Center in OFR seeks candidates for the positions of Associate Director, Financial Markets and Associate Director, Financial Institutions and Risk Management.  The Financial Markets section of the OFR conducts research on systemic risks in financial market activities.  This includes research on asset pricing and modelling, financial market microstructure, funding, market liquidity and construction of market monitors using statistical and visualization techniques.  The Financial Institutions and Risk Management section conducts research on the financial stability risk from financial institutions and financial networks, methods to assess that risk, policies to mitigate that risk, and financial institution risk management practices.  Research output includes research papers for academic and policy journals and contributions to policy analysis for the public and the Financial Stability Oversight Council and its member agencies.

Associate Directors at the OFR are responsible for setting analytical and research priorities; hiring and managing a multidisciplinary team of researchers including economists, mathematicians, and statisticians; providing leadership on financial research; contributing to recommendations on financial stability policy; and supporting the Office’s data and data standards initiatives.  Associate Directors lead a team of more than 20 researchers when fully staffed.  

Successful candidates will have excelled both in the conduct of research and the management of the research process, and should have a record of publications in high quality academic journals comparable to that required for tenure at a leading academic department.  Backgrounds in academia, policy institutions, regulatory agencies, or industry are welcome.  Candidates should demonstrate proven ability to analyze complex questions, lead multiple projects, and manage relationships with a wide range of internal and external stakeholders.  Outstanding written and oral communications skills are essential, including the ability to address a non-technical audience.  

Salaries and benefits are competitive with similar high-level positions at federal regulatory agencies covered by FIRREA.
