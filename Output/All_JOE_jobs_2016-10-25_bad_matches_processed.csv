The Academy Scholars are a select community of individuals with resourcefulness, initiative, curiosity, and originality, whose work in non-Western cultures or regions shows promise as a foundation for exceptional careers in major universities or international institutions.  Harvard Academy Scholarships are open only to recent PhD (or comparable professional school degree) recipients and doctoral candidates.  Those still pursuing a PhD should have completed their routine training and be well along in the writing of their theses before applying to become Academy Scholars; those in possession of a PhD longer than 3 years at the time of application are ineligible.

Academy Scholars are appointed for 2 years by the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies and are provided time, guidance, and access to Harvard University facilities.  They receive substantial financial and research assistance to undertake sustained projects of research and/or acquire accessory training in their chosen fields and areas.  Some teaching is permitted but not required.  The Senior Scholars, a distinguished group of senior Harvard University faculty members, act as mentors to the Academy Scholars to help them achieve their intellectual potential.

Postdoctoral Academy Scholars will receive an annual stipend of $67,000, and predoctoral Academy Scholars will receive an annual stipend of $31,000 until they are awarded the PhD or equivalent degree.  The online application for the 2017-2018 class of Academy Scholars is due by October 1, 2016.  Finalist interviews will take place in Cambridge on December 6, 2016.  Notification of Scholarships will be made in late December, 2016.

Rockefeller Visiting Faculty Fellowships for the academic year 2017-18. Fellows devote an academic year in residence at Princeton to research and writing about topics involving human values in public and private life. The program is open to all scholars provided their research plans qualify. In recent years fellows have been drawn from fields including philosophy, political theory, literature, history, classics, economics and law, but this list is not meant to be exhaustive.

Fellows are expected to reside in or around Princeton and to be active contributors to the intellectual life of the Center, including participation in a weekly seminar attended by fellows and Center faculty to discuss work in progress and in various other events sponsored by the Center. 

Candidates should have a doctorate or equivalent professional degree and a strong record of research publications appropriate to their career stage. Typically Fellows hold faculty positions at other universities or colleges; in exceptional cases we consider applications from independent scholars when there is a high level of scholarly achievement. This is not a post-doctoral fellowship program and we do not generally consider candidates who will have held the Ph.D. for less than two years at the time of appointment.

The fellowship period extends from September 1 to July 1. Fellows normally receive stipends of up to one-half their academic-year salaries (subject to a minimum and maximum set each fall). Ordinarily their home institutions provide a portion of their salaries in addition to all benefits, although this is not a requirement for appointment. Stipends for independent scholars will not exceed the maximum for fellows holding appointments elsewhere.

The main considerations in the evaluation of applications are the following:

The significance of the proposed research and its relevance to the purposes of the University Center for Human Values(see http://uchv.princeton.edu/ for more information);

The quality of a candidate’s previous research and the contribution the candidate is likely to make in the future through teaching and writing;

The likelihood that the research would benefit from being conducted in the University Center environment.

Timeline: There is no firm deadline for applying.

Summary:

We are looking for a Senior Fellow with a strong background in causal inference and quantitative research methods (either through academic coursework at the graduate level or previous work experience) and a demonstrated interest in global health and/or development to lead our work assessing the evidence and cost-effectiveness of global health and development interventions such as immunization campaigns, bednet distribution, breastfeeding promotion, etc.

This position would be a great fit for a candidate who wants to apply a rigorous methodological background toward making real-world funding decisions at a small, agile organization.

Our top charities - to which we directed over $110 million in 2015 - are evaluated largely based on the cost-effectiveness and strength of the academic evidence for the interventions they implement. In addition, we recommend a number of grants to early-stage organizations carrying out strong interventions, and studies that could improve the evidence for interventions, in the hopes that these grants will lead eventually to new top charities. 

Job description:

The Senior Fellow will contribute to our core research and will also have the opportunity to allocate some time to pursuing her/his own original research agenda including publishing in peer-reviewed journals if she/he desires.

The Senior Fellow will be responsible for:
-Prioritizing the interventions we consider for funding.
-Assessing the evidence behind an intervention: can it be causally linked to improving people's lives? How much uncertainty is there about the magnitude of this impact? All evidence should be approached in a critical, open-minded way, recognizing the case both for and against attributing causality. We do not exclusively consider randomized controlled trials, nor do we use them uncritically.
-Assessing the cost-effectiveness of an intervention: all things considered, how much good can be accomplished per dollar spent? Our cost-effectiveness models are often fairly complex and require creative approaches to making a number of judgment calls. 
-Assessing the room for more funding for an intervention: what does the global gap look like, and how practical would it be to increase delivery with increased funding?
-Working alongside staff evaluating funding opportunities to (a) evaluate evidence provided by organizations seeking funding and (b) consider the similarity between the program the organization implements and the existing evidence.
-Staying up to date on relevant academic literature that may lead to new ideas for interventions to consider for funding.

Qualifications and characteristics:

-Ph.D. in economics, public health, or statistics or equivalent experience. Exceptions may be made for outstanding applicants who do not meet this criterion.
-At least three years of research or policy-related experience. Exceptions may be made for outstanding applicants who do not meet this criterion.
-Passionate about finding great giving opportunities and making the world a better place.
-Value intense discussion and debate.
-Strong critical thinking skills; able to approach all claims (including their managers') with skepticism.
-Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal.
-Comfortable with open-ended questions, where no clear precedents or guidelines exist.
-Value the intensity and open-endedness of a small organization over the stability and comfort of a larger corporation.

Please note:

We prefer candidates who will be based at our office in San Francisco, but we are open to someone who works remotely.
We will consider sponsoring applications for work authorization for exceptional candidates.

The Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship is a one year term appointment running from mid-2017 to mid-2018, with the precise dates flexible. CGD is an independent, non-partisan, Washington, DC think tank dedicated to reducing global poverty and inequality through policy-oriented research and active engagement on development issues with the policy community and the public. We invite you to learn more about the Center at http://www.cgdev.org.

CGD studies the policies of the US and other industrialized countries that affect development prospects in poor countries. The Center aims to provide young scholars an opportunity to apply their research skills in an active policy environment, collaborating with a world-renowned research staff of economists and political scientists and taking advantage of the research support of CGD research assistants. Staff work with policymakers seeking rigorous and independent advice on development-related issues. Two Nobel Laureates currently serve on our Board and we have extensive links to top development researchers all over the world. Our previous postdocs have subsequently gone on to tenure track appointments at Stanford, U.N.C. Chapel Hill, Yale, Tufts, N.Y.U., U.C. San Diego, the University of Maryland, Georgetown University, University of Pittsburgh, and U.C. Davis. For more information about our former postdocs, please visit http://www.cgdev.org/page/postdoc.

Interested applicants should send electronic versions of a CV, job market paper, and cover letter. Applications that do not include all three items will not be considered. We also strongly encourage you to submit a letter of recommendation from your advisor, which will do much to support your application, but this is not required. Your cover letter should describe in some detail the research you would pursue during a year at CGD, and signal your willingness to move to Washington for one year (an important selection criterion). Preference will be given to candidates whose research interests align with CGD’s—which is to say that they should bear some connection, broadly interpreted, to the effect of high-income countries’ public or private sectors on low-income countries. All materials should be sent to Ms. Ellen Mackenzie at jobs@cgdev.org with “Post-Doctoral Research Fellow” in the subject line.

Postdoctoral researchers are hired for a one or two-year fixed-term appointment and receive a competitive salary/benefits package and eligible for relocation expenses. There are 2 positions open in Cambridge, MA. Candidates are required to have completed a Ph.D. in economics or closely related fields before starting at Microsoft Research. Past economics postdocs have consistently moved on to assistant professor positions at the very best departments.

Access to Data: Postdoctoral researchers have wide-ranging access to Microsoft data. While certainly not constrained to utilize Microsoft data assets, we expect empirical researchers to benefit greatly from access to data from various Microsoft businesses. In the past research has used data on online advertising auctions, Xbox Live platform, web browsing and internal datasets related to firm and employee behavior. 

Interdisciplinary: Permanent researchers include top scholars in anthropology, applied mathematics, biology, communications, computer science, economics, law, machine learning, physics, psychology, sociology and statistics, physics. Postdoctoral researchers in past years have collaborated extensively across disciplinary boundaries with great success and we expect attention to such interdisciplinary research to grow further as economics and computer science become more tightly integrated as fields.

Fields: We are particularly interested in candidates with expertise in auctions and market design, platform economics, industrial organization, personnel economics, social networks analysis, behavioral economics, economics of digitization and e-commerce and applied game theory. However, exceptional candidates in all fields will receive full consideration.

Applicants should apply through EconJobMarket (https://econjobmarket.org/postings.php?posid=4007) by submitting a job market paper, cover letter, CV, statement of research interests, and three letters of recommendation.
