We seek candidates at all experience levels for both the Research area and the Risk Analysis area. Entry level economists do not require banking research or experience. Mid-career and senior economists are expected to have experience in economics, banking, or finance. 

Research Area:
Financial Economists balance independently generated scholarly research with policy work. Research generally focuses on banking, finance, risk measurement, deposit insurance, and systemic risk, among other topics. The research is disseminated in peer-reviewed academic, industry, professional, and FDIC journals, publications, and conferences. The FDIC has an active seminar series and economists have access to a wide range of proprietary data. The FDIC supports the Center for Financial Research (CFR) which organizes conferences, sponsors visiting scholars, and undertakes other activities that support the agency's research mission (visit https://fdic.gov/bank/analytical/cfr/ for more information). In addition, the economists support agency functions in several ways. For example, they review quantitative models used by banks for measuring financial risks such as credit, interest rate, and operational risk. Economists also develop and maintain quantitative models to support FDIC functions, including: deposit insurance pricing, deposit insurance fund management, stress testing, and resolving banks in the least costly manner. Economists may also perform policy-focused research on current topics such as cross-border resolutions, international capital requirements, and the stability of deposit insurance systems.

Risk Analysis Area:
Financial Economists analyze conditions and events in the economy and financial markets. They identify emerging risks, and analyze their impact on the economy, financial markets, banking sector, and Deposit Insurance Fund. Economists perform a variety of complex quantitative and qualitative analyses, both independently and as team members, and they present findings to FDIC senior leadership, FDIC staff, and external groups through presentations, briefings, publications, and outreach events.

The FDIC is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

","Economist ","The Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) is a non-profit corporation supporting the Department of Defense and other federal government agencies with applied economics and multi-disciplinary research. IDA researchers support senior defense officials by applying economic theory to issues of National Security policy and resource management. This ranges from applying proven tools to new problems and data, to developing new models, to generating new theory. Recent examples include:
â€¢	Development of an econometric model for forecasting the supply of recruits that highlights risks to Army recruiting and suggests policy improvements; 
â€¢	Assessments of the $65B/year DoD health care program that suggest market-oriented reforms; 
â€¢	Enhancement of parametric models to forecast major weapon system costs like the Joint Strike Fighter with an expected total program cost of $233B;
â€¢	Development of metrics to measure the success of border-control initiatives; 
â€¢	Development of a stochastic model to analyze the ability of alternative force structures to address an uncertain future; 
â€¢	Hedonic analysis to correct for quality differences in calculating price indices for fighter aircraft; 
â€¢	Examination of how to select a discount rate for calculating lump-sum payments as part of the military retirement package.

IDA takes great pride in the high caliber and timeliness of its analyses, which are produced in an atmosphere that encourages independent thinking and objective results. Work at IDA is conducted in a team environment and often involves a multi-disciplinary approach with physicists, engineers, economists, and other social scientists. Researchers work closely with and are in frequent contact with government sponsors. Consequently, strong communication skills are greatly valued.

IDA has openings for highly qualified PhD economists to join its growing team, specifically in applied economics (including labor economics, public economics, industrial organization, and mechanism design).

The OCC charters, regulates, and supervises all national banks, federal branches, and agencies of foreign banks and federal savings associations. Financial Economists in Market RAD use their knowledge of modeling and analysis to evaluate the adequacy and robustness of models used by large national banks for their capital market activities and to provide advice to national bank examiners, OCC senior management and bankers on the appropriateness of model development and use, as well as model risk management processes. Quantitative models used in capital market activities include valuation and risk measurement models used for derivatives trading, asset liability management, market and counterparty risk management, mortgage banking, stress testing and regulatory capital assessment (Basel II.5 and Basel III). Our model reviews usually require us to work onsite at banks, so the job requires about 25 percent travel time. The remainder of staff time includes scholarly research for publication, policy consultation, and examiner training on various quantitative modeling issues. 

Desired Candidates (have one or more of the following examples of experience): 

- Candidates who will demonstrate interest in and have knowledge of finance/financial economic theories, quantitative methods and econometric techniques such as those developed, applied and published in academic journals, in valuation or risk analysis of financial instruments, financial markets, or financial institutions, and skill and experience in conducting research in these areas. 

- Candidates who hold a Ph.D. or have a firm expectation of completing their Ph.D. in Economics, Finance, Statistics, or related quantitative field, or they have an equivalent combination of education and industry experience. 

- Candidates with demonstrated expertise in financial economics or have a substantial publication record or significant financial industry experience in related areas.
